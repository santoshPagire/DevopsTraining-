# Project README: Deploying Lightweight Web Applications on AWS

## Project Steps and Deliverables

### 1. EC2 Instance Setup 
- **Launch EC2 Instances:**
  - Launch four EC2 t2.micro instances using Amazon Linux 2 AMI.
  - Assign tags for identification (e.g., "App1-Instance1,""App2-Instance1,").

  - SSH into each instance and deploy "App1" on two instances and "App2" on the other two.

### 2. Security Group Configuration
- **Create Security Groups:**
  - For EC2 instances: Allow inbound HTTP (port 80) and SSH (port 22) traffic from your IP.
  - For ALB: Allow inbound traffic on port 80.
  - Attach security groups to the EC2 instances and ALB.

### 3. Application Load Balancer Setup with Path-Based Routing 
- **Create an Application Load Balancer (ALB):**
  - Set up the ALB in the same VPC and subnets as the EC2 instances.

  - Configure two target groups:
    - Target Group 1: For "App1" instances.
    - Target Group 2: For "App2" instances.
  - Register EC2 instances with the appropriate target groups.

### 4. Testing and Validation 
- **Test Path-Based Routing:**
  - Access the ALBâ€™s DNS name to ensure /app1 routes to "App1" instances and /app2 routes to "App2" instances.
